# Fun-with-Lists-and-Tuples
Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples
Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]

Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]

Take a list of tuples from the user.
Define a function that returns the last element of each tuple in the list of tuples.
Define another function with the previous function as the key and sort the list.
Print the sorted list.
